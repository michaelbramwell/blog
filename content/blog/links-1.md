[Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses) - We got some JW's in the hood so I figure I should at least learn a little about their beliefs. Turns out I'm living under Satan's spell but nothing new in that respect.

[Some thoughts on 2017](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2898) - Music in 2017 is looking much more promising than other areas of civilization.

[The Prisoner](http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-prisoner/) - A 12 year old is sentenced to 27 years in jail for murder, only for it to later be extended to 40 years. Justice sans mercy Texas style.

[The 30 best reissues of 2016.](http://thevinylfactory.com/features/the-30-best-reissues-of-2016/)

[Fuck That](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/01/fck-work.html) - A response to James Livingston's [Fuck Work](https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-jobs-are-not-the-solution-but-the-problem) article that challenges the notions of full employment. I tend to agree with Livingston's sentiment as the response article tends to drift into outdated notions that only work can provide meaning and a social life.

[The Atlantic Ocean and an Actual Debate in Climate Science](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/what-a-real-debate-looks-like-in-climate-science/512444/) - What climate scientists are actually debating about, hint; More Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation less about climate change being man made or not (which is already proven and only morons now debate).

[Is Emirates Airline Running Out of Sky?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-05/is-emirates-airline-running-out-of-sky) - The current king of commercial airline has some serious challenges ahead.

[Rahawan: How We Achieved 95% Better Response Time By Mostly-Unidirectional Data Access Layer Design](https://hackernoon.com/rahawan-how-we-achieved-95-better-response-time-by-mostly-unidirectional-data-access-layer-design-1af1f87755f5#.6y9t7ss1n) - I love reading about creative solutions to specific challenges, in this case building a custom [Data Access Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer) (DAL) to better suit the needs of a news platform.
